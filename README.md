## Installation
To set all the dotfiles make sure you have stow installed and then run:  
```sh
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaphGL/Dotfiles/master/.scripts/configdf > /tmp/configdf.sh && chmod +x /tmp/configdf.sh && bash /tmp/configdf.sh; rm -f configdf.sh
```   

After setting everything up you will probably want to install the programs necessary to run dotfiles.  
Note: I've created package lists for Arch and Fedora. You can find them at `Dotfiles/.lists`.
The minimal install installs only the bare minimum to get you up and running, you will have to install most programs yourself.  

Just run your package manager like this:

```sh
sudo package_manager $(cat ~/Dotfiles/.lists/distro-packages.list)
```

After installing them you will probably want to setup keybindings for them, to do so just type the following aliases on the terminal:  
* `kb` for keyboard shortcuts
* `qtilec` for the qtile config
* `nvimc` for the neovim config
