## Installation

To install these dotfiles you either will have to use [Tuckr](https://github.com/RaphGL/Tuckr)(recommended) or GNU Stow.

Tuckr:

```sh
$ tuckr add \*
```

Stow:

1. Change directory to dotfiles/Configs
2. Run:

```sh
$ stow -t $HOME *
```

After deploying the dotfiles, you will probably want to install the programs necessary to use my setup.  
Note: I've created package lists for Arch and Fedora. You can find them at `Dotfiles/.lists`.

Just run your package manager like this:

```sh
$ sudo <PKG_MANAGER> $(cat ~/Dotfiles/.lists/<YOUR_DISTROS_LIST>)
```

If you want to use my neovim, tmux or zsh setups you can run the setup scripts at the `Hooks` directory.

If you're using Tuckr you can just run the names of the programs you want like this:

```sh
$ tuckr set nvim tmux zsh
```

## Optional Steps

After installing the packages you will probably want to tweak the system to your liking.
The following aliases redirect you to different config files related to my dotfiles:

- `kb` for keyboard shortcuts
- `qtilec` for the qtile config
- `astartc` for the startup programs
- `nvimc` for the neovim config
